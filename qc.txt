the fact that a quantum system can exist in a superposition or linear combi-
nation of states allows us to do simultaneous parallel computations that cannot be
done even, in principle, on any classical computer.This feature allows a quantum
computer to do parallel computations using a single circuit-providing a dramatic
speedup in many cases.
